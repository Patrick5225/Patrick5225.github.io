				<h1>Statistical Dunkirk</h1>
				<p>Statistical methods are constantly being misused with techniques such as
					data fishing (p-hacking). Surveys of results that report as "statistically
					significant" have suggested that many <i>p values</i> are wrong. As a result,
					the need for qualified statisticians have been constantly increasing in the
					natural sciences.

				<h2>Brief overview</h2>
				<p>There is a growing problem in the field of statistics, one being the misuse of p-values. This is done
					through <b>p-hacking</b>,
					which can be thought of as manipulating data to make it where the desired outcome seems to be
					“statistically significant” enough to draw conclusions about certain ideas. Because researchers
					use p-hacking and tries to make insignificant results seem supposedly significant, research
					has become ineffectively conducted; hence, results become biased in favor of the researchers. This
					method of “cheating” statistics seems to provoke public skepticism towards data that claim to be
					statistically significant. Due to the increase of supposedly claimed “statistically significant”
					data
					being published in scientific publications, this has come to a lack of
					trust of statisticians and their researches that they have conducted.</p>

				<p>In statistical researches, researchers express the confidence of their data in terms of a
					<b>p-value</b> (typically chosen to be 0.05 or 0.01), which is the probability that data is the
					result of random variation. If the p-value is less than the prespecified value, conductors of the
					research can claim evidence against their called <b>null hypothesis</b>, thus favoring evidence of
					the
					<b>alternative hypothesis</b>. However, it has become common for researchers to misuse the concept
					of p-values and jump straight to the positive false conclusion of their data. Several reasons may
					arise from the misusage of p-values: (1) <b>multiple comparisons</b> are made where researchers may
					continually modify their data until a null hypothesis can be rejected, (2) very few tests are
					conducted to test a p-value (we would need as many statistical tests to be conducted so we can
					claim that each data set is not the result of random variation) (3) researchers may try to account
					for variables that can make their data fall below the p-value; in other words, researchers try to
					get
					certain samples to have certain characteristics that can provide evidence against null hypothesis.
