				<h1>Billboard Year-End Charts Analysis</h1>
				<p>The Billboard Year-End chart is a chart published by Billboard
					each year that displays yearly rankings of the top 100 songs,
					which are determined by the Billboard company themself. But does Billboard
					really rank their charts based on measures such as popularity,
					as they claim?</p>

					(replace 1960 with any year between 1960-2020)
				</p>

				<h2>Brief Overview</h2>
				<p>Every year, Billboard releases chart rankings of the top 100 songs of
					the year. Each billboard chart year starts and ends around the month of
					December. According to Billboard, rankings are determined based on factors
					such as sales, amount of streams on music streaming services such
					as Spotify, and how frequently songs are played on radio stations.
					Is this true that Billboard ranks their charts according to these factors?</p>
				<p>
					In this project, I collected data of every song
					that has appeared on the Billboard Year-End charts from years
					1960-2020, along with measures such as popularity and other
					audio features of each song, to answer the question above. I also
					used the collected data to observe if there were any common
					characteristics among songs that appeared on Billboard charts,
					if there were any relationships among variables such as the
					audio features of songs and the year it was ranked on the
					charts, and to explore which artists and songs appeared most
					often.</p>

				<h2>Part 1: Web Scraping Wikipedia's Billboard Year-End Charts</h2>
				<p>This part extracts song information (rank, title, and artist) from Wikipedia pages for
					Billboard's Year-End Hot 100 charts for years 1960-2020.</p>
				<p><b>Website:</b>
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Year-End_Hot_100_singles_of_1960">
						https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Year-End_Hot_100_singles_of_1960</a>
					(Replace 1960 with any desired year between 1960-2020)
				</p>
				<p>Note that there are three years (1963, 1966, 1975) that had an
					original list, but were revised by Billboard due to errors or
					recalculations. So the old lists eventually got replaced with
					a newer list. We will account for these changes and use the
					revised lists to collect the data in our web scraping.</p>
				<strong>Import necessary libraries for scraping websites:</strong>
				<pre><code>import csv
import time
import requests
import bs4
</code></pre>
				<pre><code># Wikipedia Billboard Year-End pages from 1960-Present follow this format
base_url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Year-End_Hot_100_singles_of_{}"
</code></pre>

				<p>Below is the code used to web scrape information:</p>
				<pre><code># initizialize empty list
song_list = []
					
# loop through each year and extract relevant song information to list
for year in range(1960,2020):
	res = requests.get(base_url.format(year))
	soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup(res.text, "lxml")
					
	# break out of loop if website technical issues occur
	if res.status_code != 200:
		print("ERROR. CANNOT SCRAPE ANYMORE.")
		break

	# select revised list if it exists, else get the original list
	try:
		selection = soup.select('.wikitable')[1]
	except:
		selection = soup.select('.wikitable')[0]

	tr = selection.select('tr')

	# add each row to song list
	for item in tr[1:]:
		row_list = []

		# append rankings
		rank = item.select('td')[0].text
		row_list.append(rank)

		# append song titles
		title = item.select('td')[1].text
		row_list.append(title.strip('"'))

		# append song artists
		artist = item.select('td')[2].text
		row_list.append(artist.strip('\n'))

		# append Billboard year    
		row_list.append(year)

		# append row with all of the data above
		song_list.append(row_list)

	# slowdown to avoid making quick requests
	time.sleep(5)
</code></pre>
				<p>Let's output the first 5 rows and last 5 rows of our list of scraped data.</p>
				<p>
				<pre><b>First 5 rows:</b>
[['1', 'Theme from A Summer Place', 'Percy Faith', 1960],
['2', "He'll Have to Go", 'Jim Reeves', 1960],
['3', "Cathy's Clown", 'The Everly Brothers', 1960],
['4', 'Running Bear', 'Johnny Preston', 1960],
['5', 'Teen Angel', 'Mark Dinning', 1960]]</pre>
				<pre><b>Last 5 rows:</b>
[['96', 'Eyes on You', 'Chase Rice', 2019],
['97', 'All to Myself', 'Dan + Shay', 2019],
['98', 'Boyfriend', 'Ariana Grande and Social House', 2019],
['99', 'Walk Me Home', 'Pink', 2019],
['100', 'Robbery', 'Juice Wrld', 2019]]</pre>
				</p>
				<p>Seems like everything is working correctly. We still need song
					information for the year 2020, so we'll go ahead and do that
					now using similar code as above, but accounting for the different
					HTML formatting used in the Wikipedia page for the year 2020. If we
					check the first and last 5 rows of the 2020 list, it seems like
					everything is working as intended.</p>
				<p>
				<pre><b>First 5 rows:</b>
[['1', 'Blinding Lights', 'The Weeknd', 2020],
['2', 'Circles', 'Post Malone', 2020],
['3', 'The Box', 'Roddy Ricch', 2020],
['4', "Don't Start Now", 'Dua Lipa', 2020],
['5', 'Rockstar', 'DaBaby featuring Roddy Ricch', 2020]]</pre>
				<pre><b>Last 5 rows:</b>
[['96', 'More Than My Hometown', 'Morgan Wallen', 2020],
['97', "Lovin' on You", 'Luke Combs', 2020],
['98', 'Said Sum', 'Moneybagg Yo', 2020],
['99', 'Slide', 'H.E.R. featuring YG', 2020],
['100', 'Walk Em Down', 'NLE Choppa featuring Roddy Ricch', 2020]]</pre>
				</p>
				<p>With our final procedure, we will put everything we gathered
					together into a csv file called <i>wikipedia_scraper.csv.</i></p>

				<h3>Spotify Web API</h3>
				<p>Before we can start using Spotify's Web API, we need to link Spotify
					to an application. I already created my own application on the
					website, and will save the application's client id and client
					secret to a file I created called <i>Spotify.txt</i>. Then I will
					save these information so that Spotify can authenticate access
					to their Web API.</p>
				<pre><code>file = 'Spotify.txt'

# store client id and client secret
with open(file,'r') as f: 
	f = f.read().splitlines()
	cid = f[0]
	secret = f[1]

# authenticate requests to the Spotify Web API
client_credentials_manager = SpotifyClientCredentials(client_id=cid, client_secret=secret)
sp = spotipy.Spotify(client_credentials_manager=client_credentials_manager)</code></pre>
				<p>With authentication permitted, we will use artist name and song title
					from our dataframe to attempt and search for the corresponding
					Spotify URI. After doing so, we obtain the following table:</p>

				<h3>Splitting the artist column</h3>
				<p>There are a lot of songs without a Spotify id (1151 total).
					One reason why the Spotify ids for these songs were not extracted
					is because the get_spotify_data function does not recognize artists
					in the artist column that have multiple artists. These data contain
					strings such as "featuring", "and", and "&", so we'll split the
					artists into multiple columns that contain the primary artist
					and featured artists. Then we'll reattempt and get the Spotify ids
					along with the song popularity.</p>

				<pre>411</pre>
				<h3>Dealing with the remaining, missing Spotify ids</h3>
				<p>We dropped the amount of null values from 1151 to 411.
					At this point, there's nothing else we can do with python
					to extract the remaining Spotify ids, so the rest must
					be done manually (using Excel).</p>

				<p>Below is the Excel file for <i>spotify_ids.csv</i>.
					We can see that row 7 (with artist Brenda Lee), for example, has missing
					information.
				</p>
				<span class="image fit2">
					<img src="images/billboard/excel_start.png" alt="" />
				</span>

				<p>We can then use Excel's filter tool to filter by rows with
					missing Spotify ids, and then use Spotify to look up the ids for
					each of these songs.
				</p>
				<span class="image fit2">
					<img src="images/billboard/excel_finished_ids.png" alt="" />
				</span>

				<p>So most songs should have a Spotify id now. However, in the image
					below, there are still very few rows with missing information. Also,
					in column G, some rows have ids that start with "spotify:track:" and other rows
					without it. We'll add in another column that will remove "spotify:track"
					in the id, if it exists, and keep all other rows as is with either
					the original id or blank information using a rather long Excel formula.
				</p>
				<span class="image fit2">
					<img src="images/billboard/excel_blank_confirmation.png" alt="" />
				</span>
				<p>To understand the formula used, it checks and searches if the phrase
					"spotify:track" exists in the cell for G2 or not. If it does,
					then it will insert the id into a new cell while removing the phrase "spotify:track".
					If cell G2 does not contain the phrase "spotify:track", then it will check
					if the cell is blank or not. If the cell is blank, then the new cell will
					be blank, and if not, then the original id will be inserted into the new cell.
				</p>
				<p>As a result of the formula, it will look something like cell I2. We
					can then use the autofill feature to fill in the rest of the column.
				</p>

				<span class="image fit2">
					<img src="images/billboard/excel_formula.png" alt="" />
				</span>

				<p>After manually inserting Spotify ids and doing some cleaning
					in Excel, we import the csv file.</p>

				<p>After dropping the 3 rows, we now have no more rows
					with missing Spotify ids. We just need to deal with

					We'll test this out on a song from our dataframe.
					We'll choose the first song from our dataframe
					called "Theme from a Summer Place" by Percy
					Faith. To get the audio features, we'll need
					to use its Spotify id.</p>
				<pre><code># grab spotify id of song
song_id = music_data.loc[0]['Spotify id']

				<p>We were sucessfully able to get the audio features

				<h3>2: Comparing frequency of songs and artists</h3>
				<b>Which artists have appeared on the Billboard charts most often?</b>
				<pre><code># count number of unique, main artists
df['artist'].nunique()</code></pre>
				<pre>2368</pre>
				<span class="image fit2">
					<img src="images/billboard/common-artists-barchart.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>It is important to note that these counts are based
					on the artists being the main artist of their
					respective song. It does not take into account
					that the artists could be featured in a song
					with other singers. Nevertheless, most of these artists
					are pop artists.</p>
				<p>Let's check what the highest ranking that these artists have ever obtained.</p>
				<pre>
Drake              1
Elton John         1
Mariah Carey       1
The Beatles        1
Usher              1
Madonna            2
Michael Jackson    2
Rihanna            2
Janet Jackson      3
Taylor Swift       5
Name: rank, dtype: int64</pre>
				<p>Half of these artists have achieved rank #1 in the
					history of Billboard Year-End charts. The other
					half are very close, having ranked at least
					top 5.</p>
				<b>How do songs that were performed solo compare
					to those performed by multiple artists?</b>
				<p>The next thing I want to take a look at is to observe
					the percentage of songs that were performed
					solo by a single artist versus the percentage
					of songs that were performed with multiple
					artists.</p>
				<pre><code># counts number of songs that don't have other performing artists 
# (in other words, count songs with a single performer)
df[df['other artists'] != "None"]["other artists"].count()
</code></pre>
				<pre>1220</pre>
				<span class="image fit2">
					<img src="images/billboard/amount-singers-piechart.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Interestingly enough, the majority of the songs that
					appeared on the Billboard Year-End charts are those
					that were performed with multiple performers.</p>
				<b>Are there songs that have appeared most often on
					Billboard charts?</b>
				<pre>artist               title                     
3 Doors Down         Here Without You              2
						Kryptonite                    2
5 Seconds of Summer  Youngblood                    2
69 Boyz              Tootsee Roll                  2
98 Degrees           Because of You                2
Aaliyah              The One I Gave My Heart To    2
Ace of Base          All That She Wants            2
Adele                Hello                         2
						Rolling in the Deep           2
Akon                 Smack That                    2
dtype: int64</pre>
				<p>Seems like the most amount of times that a song can
					occur on the Billboard Year-End charts is just 2.
					There isn't much else we can analyze from here
					so let's move on.</p>
				<h3>3: Exploring the popularity field</h3>
				<b>What are the most and least popular songs?</b>
				<p>Top 10 most popular songs:</p>
				<span class="image fit">
					<img src="images/billboard/most-popular-songs-table.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Top 10 least popular songs:</p>
				<span class="image fit">
					<img src="images/billboard/least-popular-songs-table.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>The most popular songs are those that appeared on the Billboard chart of 2020.
					The last popular songs all appeared on charts before 2000 and have a popularity
					score of 0.
				</p>
				<b>How does popularity of songs change by year?</b>
				<span class="image fit2">
					<img src="images/billboard/popularity-by-year-barchart.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>From the barplot above, we can see that songs generally
					get more popular as the year increases.</p>
				<b>Key points to make:</b>
				<p>First, it looks like the most popular songs were those
					that appeared on the Billboard charts for 2020.
					This makes sense as the data was extracted around
					the time that Billboard released their 2020 Year-End
					chart, and the measure of the Popularity field is
					based on how popular the song was at the time the
					data was extracted.</p>
				<p>Second, the least popular songs were those that appeared
					on older Billboard charts, mainly in years before 2000.
					Again, based on the date of when the data was
					extracted, we expect that older songs will not be as
					popular as newly released songs.</p>
				<p>Since the data was extracted on January 7, 2021, we will focus
					on exploring the popularity of songs that appeared
					in the 2020 Year-End chart. We will then see if there
					how popularity is distributed among these songs.</p>
				<b>Does Billboard's 2020 Year-End chart really take into
					account of a song's popularity for rankings?</b>
				<span class="image fit2">
					<img src="images/billboard/popularity-2020-histogram.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>A lot of these songs are quite popular! The lowest
					popularity score is only in the 70s. It may seem like
					Billboard really does take into account of a song's
					popularity for ranking songs that appear in their
					charts. Out of curiosity, let's see which songs
					were the most and least popular of 2020.</p>
				<p>Most popular songs of 2020:</p>
				<span class="image fit">
					<img src="images/billboard/most-popular-songs-2020-table.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Least popular songs of 2020:</p>
				<span class="image fit">
					<img src="images/billboard/least-popular-songs-2020-table.png" alt="" /></span>
				<b>What is the correlation between ranking and popularity?</b>
				<p>One more thing I'd like to explore is if there is some
					association between the popularity of a song and the
					rank it gets on the Billboard charts. Since the
					popularity field is largely determined by when the
					data was pulled, it would make most sense to just
					limit our observation to the 2020 Year-End chart.</p>
				<span class="image fit">
					<img src="images/billboard/popularity-vs-ranking-scatterplot.png" alt="" /></span>
				<pre><code># correlation coefficient between ranking and popularity
round(abs(df[df['year'] == 2020]['rank'].corr(df[df['year'] == 2020]['Popularity'])),2)</code></pre>
				<pre>0.49</pre>
				<p>With a correlation coefficient of <strong>r = 0.49</strong>, there is a
					moderately strong relationship between the popularity
					of a song and how high it ranks on the Billboard
					Year-End charts. That is, the higher popularity a song
					is, the higher rank it is on the chart. Popularity does
					have some role on affecting how high a song will rank on the chart.</p>
				<h3>4: Exploring the audio features</h3>
				<p>Let's explore the audio features of each Billboard song
					and see how they are distributed and if they have any
					correlations with other fields.</p>
				<b>How are audio features correlated with themselves and with year/rank?</b>
				<span class="image fit2">
					<img src="images/billboard/audio-vs-rankyear-table.png" alt="" /></span>
				<span class="image fit2">
					<img src="images/billboard/correlation-features-heatmaps.png" alt="" /></span>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
						<p></p>
						<b>Key takeaways from audio features versus other audio features:</b>
						<ul>
							<li>Strongest correlations occur with energy
								vs. loudness, where songs with higher energy
								are generally associated with songs with
								higher loudness.</li>
							<li>Moderate correlations occur with valence
								vs. danceability, and valence vs. energy.</li>
							<li>All other correlations have weak correlations.</li>
						</ul>
						<b>Comparing audio features versus year:</b>
						<ul>
							<li>The only features with (moderately) strong
								positive correlations with year are loudness,
								energy, and danceability. That is, as the
								year increases, music tends to be more
								loud, energetic, and have higher
								danceability to their songs.</li>
							<li>One feature, acousticness, seems to have the
								lowest correlation with year. As the year
								increases, songs somewhat tend to have
								less of an acoustic style to them.</li>
						</ul>
						<b>Comparing audio features versus rankings:</b>
						<ul>
							<li>There are no correlations whatsoever between
								the features of a song versus ranking.
								It seems like the characteristics of songs
								have no affect on how they get ranked
								on the Billboard charts.</li>
						</ul>

					</div>
				</div>
				<h4>Distribution of audio features</h4>
				<b>What audio features are most common? How are they all distributed?</b>
				<p></p>
				<span class="image fit2">
					<img src="images/billboard/audio-distributions.png" alt="" /></span>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
						<p></p>
						<b>Key takeaways</b>
						<ul>
							<li>Danceability, energy, tempo, and
								loudness seems to be the most
								normally distributed features</li>
							<li>Most songs are played in a 4/4 time signature</li>
							<li>Songs on the Billboard charts tend
								to score low on its speechiness,
								liveness, and acousticness</li>
							<li>Almost all songs have a very low
								instrumentalness score, meaning
								most songs contain vocal tracks</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>I was initially interested in seeing how Billboard chooses
					what songs to rank on their charts and what the
					characteristics of these songs were. After exploring
					the data, it seems that the most common artists were
					singers in the Pop genre, with singers like Madonna
					and Rihanna taking most of the spots in the Billboard
					charts. Most of the songs were performed with other
					singers rather than solo.</p>
				<p>Exploring the popularity of the songs was most intriguing
					to me as the analysis did seem to show that Billboard does
					tend to choose popular songs, as they claimed. I was also
					fascinated by looking at the characteristics of the songs.
					Newer released songs tend to be more popular than older
					songs. Newer songs are also generally louder, more
					energetic, and danceable than older songs, which really
					shows how music in general has changed over time.</p>
