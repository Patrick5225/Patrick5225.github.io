				<h1>Amazon Alexa Products Analysis</h1>
				<p>Amazon is well-known for selling products on its website. For this
					analysis, we'll be focusing on Amazon Alexa products (products
					that has a virtual assistant AI named Alexa), including
					products like the Amazon Echo, Amazon TV Sticks, etc. We'll analyze
					a dataset containing reviews of these Amazon Alexa products and
					observe what customers think about the products.</p>

## 3148 I do love these things, i have them running my entire home, TV, all my lights, my thermostat, my front do
or dead bolt, the cameras... and i love listening to npr. these things are well worth the value and they really s
hine once you stat adding smart devices and you can control your entire home like its right out of star trek....
I named mine computer to get the feel... but its amazing what you can do with these devices and smart systems.
## 3149                                                              Only complaint I have is that the sound qual
ity isn't great. I mostly use it for commands though, and I have another dot hooked up to my stereo system to pla
y music through. I have a couple friends that have a dot and don't mind the audio quality, but if you're bothered
 by that kind of thing I'd go with the full size echo or make sure you hook the do up to some larger speakers.

				</div>

				<p>Just by observing the summary statistics, we see that the mean of the rating
					and feedback are quite high. We will observe this further in our exploratory
					data analysis later.</p>

				<div class="box">
					<pre>##     rating
## 1        5
## 3        4
## 7        3
## 47       2
## 142      1</pre>
				</div>

				<p>Ratings on this data only take in whole number values from 1
					through 5. Note that the index number just represents the index
					of the row where each unique rating is first encountered in the
					dataset.</p>

				<p>Now, is there any association between rating and feedback? As noted,
					a value of 0 for feedback means that the feedback as negative,
					and a value of 1 for feedback indicates a positive feedback.</p>

				<div class="box">
					<pre>## # A tibble: 2 x 3
##   feedback minimum_rating maximum_rating
## *    &lt;int>          &lt;int>          &lt;int>

## 2        1              3              5</pre>
				</div>

				<p>It seems that negative feedbacks only have ratings of either a
					1 or a 2, and positive feedbacks have ratings of 3 or higher.</p>

				<p>Next, let's check the range of dates of the date field.</p>

				<div class="box">
					<pre>##   earliest_date latest_date

				<p>The range of dates of the entire dataframe are all in the year
					2018 from the months of May to July.</p>

sum(is.na(df))</code></pre>

				<div class="box">
					<pre>## [1] 0</pre>
				</div>

				<p>There are no missing values on the data, so we do not have to
					worry about working with them.</p>

				<!-- Part 2 -->
				<h2>Part 2: Measuring Ratings and Reviews</h2>
				<p><b>How are the ratings distributed for Amazon products?
						Which rating occurs most often?</b></p>
				<p>Let's start by looking at a bar chart of the ratings to see what
					people think of Amazon Alexa products.</p>
				<span class="image fit">
					<img src="images/amazon-reviews/ratings-barchart.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>There is a large number of people who rated Amazon products with a 5.
					A rating of a 4 falls second by a large margin compared to ratings
					of a 5. It seems like the majority of customers who have reviewed
					the products are satisfied with their purchase.</p>
				<p><b>How often were reviews written on each month and each day of
						the week?</b></p>
				<span class="image fit">
					<img src="images/amazon-reviews/month-reviews.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Most of the reviews from the data were written on the month of July.
					This graph could just have been a result of how the data was
					originally extracted.</p>
				<span class="image fit">
					<img src="images/amazon-reviews/day-reviews.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Most reviews were written on Mondays and Sundays. A plausible
					explanation for this could be that most people order products
					on Fridays or during the weekend. And since Amazon guarantees
					a 2-day delivery date for customers who are members of Amazon
					Prime, people will write their reviews on Sunday or Monday,
					the same day they receive their delivery.</p>
				<p><b>What were the average ratings by month or day of week?</b></p>
				<span class="image fit">
					<img src="images/amazon-reviews/avg-rating-month.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>The average ratings are quite similar to each other, with ratings
					from each month being higher than 4.00 and July having the highest
					rating of all months. Though, we should be careful with comparing
					July to the other months since July had much more reviews than
					May and June.</p>
				<span class="image fit">
					<img src="images/amazon-reviews/avg-rating-day.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Average ratings are all above 4.00 and are not too much different
					from each other. The highest average ratings occur on the weekend,
					Monday, and Wednesday, where each ratings are around 4.5. Reviews
					written on Thursdays and Fridays have the lowest average ratings.</p>

				<span id="part-3"></span>
				<hr />

				<!-- Part 3 -->
				<h2>Part 3: Looking at the different variations of Amazon Products</h2>
				<p>Let's observe if there are any specific variations that customers
					prefer over the other.</p>
				<p><b>Which variation are most frequently rated, and which have the
						highest average rating?</b></p>
				<span class="image fit">
					<img src="images/amazon-reviews/variation.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>The bar chart shows that customers in the dataset have mostly
					bought black-colored products.</p>
				<span class="image fit">
					<img src="images/amazon-reviews/avg-rating-variation.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>All products have average ratings of more than 4.00. Highest
					average rated products seem to be Walnut Finish and Oak Finish,
					but note that these products didn't have much reviews to begin
					with as shown in the bar chart of variation of products. Fabric
					products are the next highest average rated products and have
					much more reviews than the Finish products.</p>

				<span id="part-4"></span>
				<hr />

				<!-- Part 4 -->
				<h2>Part 4: Length of Reviews</h2>
				<p><b>What is the distribution of the length of reviews?</b></p>
				<span class="image fit">
					<img src="images/amazon-reviews/length-histogram.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Most reviews seems to be below 50 words, but there are some huge
					outliers with length of reviews beyond 100 words. We can filter
					out outliers using the Interquartile Range Rule and plot another
					histogram to better see the distribution of length of reviews.</p>
				<span class="image fit">
					<img src="images/amazon-reviews/length-no-outliers-histogram.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>We can tell that most reviews are pretty short with word counts of
					less than 20.</p>
				<span class="image fit">
					<img src="images/amazon-reviews/length-boxplot.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Most reviews are short in terms of amount of words it has,
					regardless of what the rating seems to be. Let's examine the
					boxplot closer by filtering using the same IQR rule on review
					length.</p>
				<span class="image fit">
					<img src="images/amazon-reviews/length-no-outliers-boxplot.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Reviews rated with a 2 are generally the longest reviews compared
					to other reviews. Reviews that have a rating of a 5 tends to be
					the shortest.</p>

				<span id="part-5"></span>
				<hr />

				<!-- Part 5 -->
				<h2>Part 5: What are reviews saying?</h2>
				<p><b>What are some of the most commonly used words in reviews of
						Amazon products by positive and negative reviews?</b></p>
				<span class="image fit">
					<img src="images/amazon-reviews/wordcloud.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>In the word cloud above, the most used words are indicated by size.
					So larger sized words mean higher counts, and smaller sized words
					mean lower counts. Also, the words are colored by sentiment where
					the green-colored words are positive words and red-colored words
					are negative. For the most part, we can see that Amazon products
					are liked by customers, where they used words such as "love"
					and "great" in their reviews.</p>
				<p>Let's see the actual numbers by looking at bar charts of the amount
					of times these words occur.</p>
				<span class="image fit">
					<img src="images/amazon-reviews/top-words.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Words like "love" and "great" do indeed take the top spots for
					most frequently used positive words in reviews, as we speculated
					from the word cloud. Moreover, these positive words have high
					counts, so it seems that Amazon products are doing great
					overall.</p>
				<p>If we look at the negative words, we see that there are indeed
					words that can be considered negative such as "issues" and
					"problems", but the word "alarm" might be an invalid word
					to be classified as negative, so this is a word on the bar
					chart that we should be careful about.</p>
				<p>Still, the word counts of negative words are quite low, so there
					seem to be far less customers who said negative things compared
					to customers who said positive things about the Amazon products
					in their reviews.</p>

				<hr />

				<!-- Conclusion -->
				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>Overall, it seems like customers are satisfied with their Amazon
					Alexa products. We measured the ratings and reviews and observed
					that most reviews gave a rating of 5. Ratings among the variation
					of products are quite similar to each other and are all doing
					well. Generally, lower ratings have higher word counts than
					higher ratings. Also, many reviews have left positive feelings
					about the Amazon products indicating that the customers loved
					and think that the products are great. But there are reviews
					in the other hand that have given negative feedback saying
					that the customers has issues or problems and are
					disappointed with their purchase.</p>
